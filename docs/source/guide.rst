Getting started
=================

Please refer to the :doc:`install`-chapter to learn how to install geo3py.


geo3py is still under development, and not all functionality is yet covered.

One should also be aware of certain limitations, and differences between geo3py and the Maple-version.
E.g. geo3py is mainly based on sympy, which does not always evaluate and simplify expressions in the same way as Maple does.
